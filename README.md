## Examples

#### download object and list object

```bash
$ s3local download -u s3://mybucket/artifacts/ --debug
2021-05-14 11:27:13,367 DEBUG - Copying: s3://mybucket/artifacts/main.log > /Users/hiroshi.toyama/.s3local/s3/mybucket/artifacts/main.log
2021-05-14 11:27:13,367 DEBUG - Copying: s3://mybucket/artifacts/main2.log > /Users/hiroshi.toyama/.s3local/s3/mybucket/artifacts/main2.log
2021-05-14 11:27:13,367 DEBUG - Copying: s3://mybucket/artifacts/main3.log > /Users/hiroshi.toyama/.s3local/s3/mybucket/artifacts/main3.log
```

By default `$HOME/.s3local` is the root directory.

The format of path in local is as follows:

```
$HOME/.s3local/s3/${bucket}/${key}
```

You can change root by setting an environment variable S3LOCAL_ROOT.

```bash
$ s3local list-local -u s3://mybucket/artifacts/
/Users/hiroshi.toyama/.s3local/s3/mybucket/artifacts/main.log
/Users/hiroshi.toyama/.s3local/s3/mybucket/artifacts/main2.log
/Users/hiroshi.toyama/.s3local/s3/mybucket/artifacts/main3.log
```

from s3local import S3local

s3local = S3local("s3://mybucket/artifacts/")
